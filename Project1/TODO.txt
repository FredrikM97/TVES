# TODO
* What kind of interfaces
* Approach to develop tests
* Assumptions / decisions
* Why we used 




# Assumptions
	* Sensor 1 cm at time 
	* Sensors at same position
	* Sensor scanning width in meters!
	* If Sensor show bad info once we assume they never recover
	* Standard deviation (threshhold: 10) 
	* Assumption to check that we are parked when trying to unpark
	* Assume car width is 170 cm
	* 


# Interfaces
	* Abstract
	* Variables
	* Describe implementation through UML
